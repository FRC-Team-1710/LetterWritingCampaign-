Hi! This is Rahi Dasgupta.
How are you and your family doing?
As you know, I am in my sophomore year of high school and I am a part of our school's FIRST Robotics team. 
Last year, I got an amazing opportunity to be a member of the programming team and I am thankful to be reselected to programming this year!
During last year's competition, I was almost in tears when I saw the robot come alive using my code that I worked so hard to make work. 
Our team is lucky enough to go through the journey to create a successful robot year after year but we need funding to make that possible.
