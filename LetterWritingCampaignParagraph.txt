Hi! This is Rahi Dasgupta.
How are you and your family doing?
As you know, I am in my sophomore year of high school and I am a part of our school's FIRST Robotics team. 
Last year, I got an amazing opportunity to be a member of the programming team and I am thankful to be reselected to programming this year!
During last year's competition, I was almost in tears when I saw the robot come alive using my code that I worked so hard to make work. 
Our team is lucky enough to go through the journey to create a successful robot year after year but we need funding to make that possible. 
All of the money we receive will go to the team in order to create a high standing robot as well improve our initiatives such as You Go Girl, You Are Not Alone, and so many more!
Through our You Go Girl initiative, we have impacted so many young women in STEM and we hope to continue that as we grow as a team. 
Our You Are Not Alone focuses on mental health and how to help the millions of people overcome their challenges with mental health. 
Any amount would greatly help our team advance with our intiatives and our robot!
