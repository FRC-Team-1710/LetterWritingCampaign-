As you know, I am a part of the FIRST Robotics team 1710 here at Olathe Northwest Highschool. I just wanted to let you know more about what I do on the team. This year, I was selected for the programming subteam. This means that I get to program and code the robot to do what we need. So far, we have been practicing making and sharing code so that when we get to code the actual robot, things go over smoothly. I am having a great time learning how to code and collaborate on the team, however, this year especially, we are in need of funds to keep this team running due to limited in person fundraisers.
