As you probably know I am on team 1710 again this year, I’ve been having a blast but robots are expensive! This letter is one fundraising method we are using this year, and as much as I don't like asking for money I certainly can't pay for the R&D that our team does for our robot. With that in mind, I'd like to say that by donating to our team, you are not only paying for a robot but also contributing to an experience that in my opinion is rivaled to no other. The experience I gain from being on this team is not something that I will take with me for the rest of my life. It is totally fine if you don't donate because we do have other means of fundraising but every bit helps!
