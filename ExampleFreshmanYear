As you know, I made the robotics team! And as you both also probably know its has been a long time goal of mine to be on the team so this year is really exciting for me. A large part of being on the team is fundraising and outreach and just in general getting the word out about the team, and that's what this is. The leadership team is having us send out fundraising letters to family members, close friends, and businesses to raise money for this year. As you read this, remember that every little bit counts!
