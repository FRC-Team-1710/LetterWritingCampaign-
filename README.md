Charlie's Paragraph
<br>
Hi! I’ve been given the amazing opportunity to be a part of Olathe Northwest’s FIRST Robotics Team 1710 again this year. I am a programmer again this year, which means I type code to help the robot move, as well as work on other various web development projects. Last year, Team 1710 gave me access to many different resources and mentors that helped me learn many new things! I had major projects like our teams Scouting App that I worked on, as well as minor projects like LEDs. Through this team, I was able to learn full stack web development last year, which is something HUGE that could definitely help me with a career in the future. I also got the opportunity to meet the development staff at Children’s Mercy last year through my robotics team. We got a firsthand look at what software development looks like in a real-world scenario. Due to the coronavirus, it is more difficult for my team to find fundraising and outreach opportunities, so if you would be able to donate a little bit to our efforts, I would be greatly appreciative!
